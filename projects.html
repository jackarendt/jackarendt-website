                    <p>Odds Are started off as a series of mockups for a UI/UX design course, but developed in to a full featured application. The app combines the excitement of daring your friends with social, and allows you to keep up with what your friends are daring each other to do on the newsfeed. The app is written in Swift 1.2 and has been live on the App Store since July 2015. I wrote the entire iOS application, and created all mockups prior to release. Our server is currently Parse, which uses Backbone.js for server logic, and sending out APNs.</p>

                    <p>Pipeline is a pipe-based maze game. Combine all the pipe pieces to connect the pipe. The only caveat is that all the pieces need to be used to complete the level! There are currently 96 levels on Pipeline. It was released on the App Store in February 2015, and has been downloaded in over fifteen countries. The app is written in Objective-C and uses Core Data to store all level/user data.</p>

                    <p>MFS Mobile was my first mobile app, and was created for <a href="http://munifs.com">Municipal Funding Solutions</a>.  The app currently lets a user submit a new listing for a municpal item such as a firetruck.  The app was written in Objective-C but is currently being redesigned.  The redesign will use swift, as well as <a href="https://parse.com">Parse</a> as a backend for new funcitonality.</p>

                    <p>This website is a living document, and my first website!  I'm still learning web dev, am still very much a beginner.  I created the first draft of the site in under two days, and did all of the design myself.  I'm currently using bootstrap, to manage most of my views.  As I learn more about web, I'll attempt to remove the bootstrap, and create more and more of it from scratch.</p>

                    <p>My senior year at UIUC, I helped create a five-staged pipelined processor using System Verilog.  The processor is based on the LC-3, and utilizes a multi-level cache with a write eviction buffer.  Most of my work was concentrated on creating the cache.  The cache consists of an I-cache and D-cache, as well as a 4-way set-associative L2 cache, with a 256 bit word size.  By making the L2 cache larger, and multicycle; we saw a performance boost of roughly 5-7%.

                    <p>My junior year at UIUC, I helped create air hockey on an FPGA.  The program was written in VHDL and utilized a keyboard driver and a VGA driver for interaction.  The game allowed for multi-user input on the same keyboard.  The game also utilized sprites for the puck and the sticks. </p>

                    <h3 class='project-title'>DYNAMIC LOAD BALANCER</h3>
                    <p>My senior year at UIUC, I helped create a dynamic load balancer across two linux servers.  Using python, my team and I created an application that monitored CPU performance, and could transfer jobs between two nodes.  You could dynamically throttle CPU workload, so if you wanted to limit one node, it was possible to transfer over jobs immediately after.  The best part of the load balancer was when we set both throttle values to zero.  It was just fun to watch the two nodes throw jobs back and forth and watch no work get done.</p>

                    <p>One of the major difficulties that we faced was speed.  Our test was running a for loop that executed a lot of floating point multiplication operations.  We noticed that it was taking a very long time to process a single job.  The problem ended up being that the python compiler didn't optimize the floating point operations, and it was taking a lot of time to execute.  We switched over to the c-types library to execute the jobs.  After doing the jobs in C, rather than python, we saw a huge boost in performance, and our load balancer was running like a charm.</p>
